# SUMMARY

<a id="anything-you-like"></a>
## What Are We Talking About?
Bellabeat is a wellness company and tech-driven manufacturer of health-focused smart products which offers a variety of smart devices that collect data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits.

The focus of the case study is to select one Bellabeat product (the Leaf Health Fitness Tracker) and analyze smart device usage data of non-Bellabeat smart devises (Fitbit) to understand how consumers are using their smart devises.

The analytical insights of available consumer data of smart devises would reveal more growth opportunities for Bellabeat. The purpose of this data analysis may assist users to understand their habits and make better health and wellness decisions.

## Business Task
The issue is that Bellabeat is a small company with the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market and it is looking to unlock new growth opportunities. Analyzing smart devise fitness data could help unlock new areas for growth and development. I was presented with the business task to identify trends on how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices to inform Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.  

<a id="anything-you-like"></a>
## The Research Questions
1.) How do consumers of Fitbit products use smart devises to gain insights into new growth opportunities for Bellabeat?

2.) What growth opportunity exist for Bellabeat based on results?

## Dataset
The data source used for the case study is Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data. This dataset is stored in Kaggle and was made available through Möbius. The dataset contains personal fitness tracker from thirty Fitbit users. The dataset includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.

## Information About the Dataset
Respondents generated this dataset to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. The variation between output represents the use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors and preferences. The dataset includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that we can use to explore users’ habits.

## Data Organization, Sorting, Verification
Data Organization. The Fitabase data folder contains 18 .CSV files that provides quantitative information which includes daily activity, calories, intensities, steps, heartrate, sleep, and weight log. The spreadsheet contains data of each uniquely identified subject in multiple rows based on activity date. The data is considered a long format since there is one observation row per subject where each subject will have data in multiple rows. Each user has a unique ID with multiple rows of data for each tracked by day and time.


Verification. I first converted the files from .CSV to Excel for ease of data organization because upon opening certain files the spreadsheets indicated that certain .CSV files contained data with over 1.3 million rows. Tables in Apple Numbers application for .CSV files cannot support more than one million rows. Thus, I used Excel to sort the sample and filtered the tables using Pivot Tables. I verified attributes, observations, and relations between each table. I counted the sample size (number of users) and verified the analysis of the length of time as 31 days.

## Limitations
A limitation of a sampling bias could be presented due to the small size resulting between 8 users (minimum) to 33 users (maximum) and lack of demographic information. The dataset does not reveal whether the sample is representative of the whole population. Another potential issue is the relevancy of the information could be outdated since the scope of the data set reveals information from 2016 within a three-month time frame, March to May. Our case study entails an operational approach tapping into data to extract valuable insights.

# PROCESS PHASE

I analyzed the data using R due to the vast amount of data, accessibility, and the ability to create data visualization to share the results with the stakeholders.

## Initial Cleaning Process
The unzipped dataset was first downloaded as a .CSV file. I then used Excel to take a first look at the dataset. Upon previewing the dataset, I noticed that one column had the date and time combined in each cell. I cleaned the spreadsheets by splitting the value into a separate date and time column using the integer (INT) function. I used pivot tables to count the unique identifications and to explore the range of dates. I transformed the data from Excel to .CSV so I can work with it effectively in RStudio.

## Installing Packages and Opening Libraries
I continued my analysis in R and chose the following package tools to assist in the analysis.

Packages: tidyverse, here, skimr, janitor, dplyr, lubridate, ggpubr, ggrepel

## Importing Datasets
After reviewing the datasets, I used appropriate file-naming conventions and renamed the files. I uploaded the datasets that will help answer the business task. For the analysis, I focus on the following datasets:


•  Daily_Activity 

•  Daily_Sleep 

•  Daily_Intensities 



Note: The weight (8 Users) and heart rate (7 users) data files was excluded from the analysis due to its small sample size.


<a id="anything-you-like"></a>
## Previewing the Datasets
I previewed the data frames in the environment pane and reviewed the summary of each column using the codes: head(filename), str(filename), skim_without_charts(filename)

The Daily_Activity dataset showed a data frame containing 940 rows and 15 columns. 

The Daily_Sleep dataset showed a data frame containing 413 rows and 6 columns. 

The Daily_Intensities dataset showed a data frame containing 940 rows and 10 columns.

## Secondary Cleaning and Formatting Process
I cleaned the column names to make sure the column names were consistent.
